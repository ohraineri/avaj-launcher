In order to create great software, one doesn’t only write code, one needs to design
it first. This project will introduce to you the concept of UML class diagrams and ob-
ject oriented design patterns, all implemented in the Java language. Writing Java code
is easy since it’s very similar to C, but the real challenge is to write good OO code in Java.

A minimal aircraft simulation program based on a provided UML class diagram. UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is widely used in software engineering to visualize the design of an application before writing any code. It provides developers with a standardized way to structure and think about object-oriented software, ensuring the design is well-defined prior to implementation.
